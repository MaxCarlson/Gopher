# Gopher
Gopher is a Go game engine that uses Monte Carlo Tree Search with UCT. Currently working on integrating [GoNet](https://github.com/MaxCarlson/GoNet) into the search, which is requiring almost a complete rework of the search. At somepoint I'll likely join the search utilities so that the Net files aren't necessary.

##Under Construction
Once the Net is integrated and everything is up and running again I'll add some pictures/video of Gophers use and play.
